#' @details
#' Activity counts cannot be reintegrated into shorter epochs, e.g.,
#' 60s -> 10s. Currently, [collapse_epochs()] integrates into 60s
#' epochs only. This is not general but is sufficient for sleep
#' analysis because the standard Sadeh and Cole-Kripke sleep algorithms
#' were developed for 60s epoch data.
#'
#' Suppose we want to collapse from 15 to 60 seconds. A complete 60s
#' epoch consists of four 15s epochs: 00, 15, 45 and 60. However, the
#' first and last epochs would be incomplete if the device started/stopped
#' collecting data mid-minute. ActiLife 6 uses these epochs anyway.
#' For example, if only 45 and 60 are available for the first minute,
#' then ActiLife will aggregate across these two epochs only. This is
#' a reasonable approach to sleep analysis with the Sadeh and the
#' Cole-Kripke algorithms which pad the beginning and the end of the
#' time series with zeros anyway.
