\usage{
apply_troiano(
  agdb,
  activity_threshold = 0,
  min_period_len = 60,

}
\arguments{
\item{agdb}{A \code{tibble} of activity data with an \code{epochlength} attribute.
The epoch length must be 60 seconds.}

\item{activity_threshold}{Highest activity level to be considered
"zero"; an epoch with activity exceeding the threshold is considered
a "spike". The default threshold is 0.}

\item{min_period_len}{Minimum number of consecutive "zero" epoch to
start a non-wear period. The default is 60.}

\item{max_nonzero_count}{Epochs with activity greater than
\code{max_nonzero_count} are labeled as "zero". The default is Inf.}

\item{spike_tolerance}{Also known as artifactual movement interval.
At most \code{spike_tolerance} "nonzero" epochs can occur in sequence
during a non-wear period without interrupting it. The default is 2.}

\item{spike_stoplevel}{An activity spike that exceeds \code{spike_stoplevel}
counts ends a non-wear period, even if the spike tolerance has not been
reached. The default is 100.}

\item{use_magnitude}{Logical. If true, the magnitude of the vector
(axis1, axis2, axis3) is used to measure activity; otherwise the axis1
value is used. The default is FALSE.}

\item{endat_nnz_seq}{Logical. If true, a non-wear period ends with a run
of nonzero epochs that is longer than \code{spike_tolerance}. This
corresponds to the option \emph{"Require consecutive epochs outside of
the activity threshold"} in ActiLife's Wear Time Validation menu.
The default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A summary \code{tibble} of the detected non-wear periods.
If the activity data is grouped, then non-wear periods are detected
separately for each group.
}
\description{
The Troiano algorithm detects periods of non-wear in activity data
from an ActiGraph device. Such intervals are likely to represent
invalid data and therefore should be excluded from downstream
analysis. The algorithm formalizes a technique used to analyze the
2003-2004 NHANES data; the original SAS source code can be found at
\url{https://riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/nhanes_pam/}.
}
\details{
The Troiano algorithm specifies that a non-wear period starts with
\code{min_period_len} consecutive epochs/minutes of "zero" activity
and ends with more than \code{spike_tolerance} epochs/minutes of
"nonzero" activity.

This implementation of the algorithm expects 60s epochs.
