}
\description{
Read ActiGraph sleep watch data from an SQLite database stored in an
AGD file and return a list with (at least) five tables: data, sleep,
filters, settings, awakenings. The tables have the schema described
in the ActiLife 6 User manual and the timestamps are converted from
Unix time format to human-readable POSIXct representation.
}
\details{
Some ActiGraph devices contain a capacitive sensor to detect
monitor removal when worn against the skin. If that data is
available, the return list includes a capsense table as well.
