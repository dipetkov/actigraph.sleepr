\usage{
apply_choi(
  agdb,
  min_period_len = 90,
  min_window_len = 30,
  spike_tolerance = 2,
  use_magnitude = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{agdb}{A \code{tibble} of activity data with an \code{epochlength} attribute.
The epoch length must be 60 seconds.}

\item{min_period_len}{Minimum number of consecutive "zero" epochs
to start a non-wear period. The default is 90.}

\item{min_window_len}{The minimum number of consecutive "zero" epochs
immediately preceding and following a spike of artifactual movement.
The default is 30.}

\item{spike_tolerance}{Also known as artifactual movement interval.
At most \code{spike_tolerance} "nonzero" epochs can occur in sequence
during a non-wear period without interrupting it. The default is 2.}

\item{use_magnitude}{Logical. If true, the magnitude of the vector
(axis1, axis2, axis3) is used to measure activity; otherwise the axis1
value is used. The default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A summary \code{tibble} of the detected non-wear periods.
If the activity data is grouped, then non-wear periods are
detected separately for each group.
}
\description{
The Choi algorithm detects periods of non-wear in activity
data from an ActiGraph device. Such intervals are likely to
represent invalid data and therefore should be excluded from
downstream analysis.
}
\details{
The Choi algorithm extends the Troiano algorithm by requiring that
short spikes of artifactual movement during a non-wear period are
preceded and followed by \code{min_window_len} consecutive "zero" epochs.

This implementation of the algorithm expects that the epochs are 60
second long.
