\title{Apply the Cole-Kripke algorithm}
\usage{
apply_cole_kripke(agdb)
}
\arguments{
\item{agdb}{A \code{tibble} of activity data with an \code{epochlength} attribute.
The epoch length must be 60 seconds.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} of activity data. A new column \code{sleep} indicates
whether each 60s epoch is scored as asleep (S) or awake (W).
}
\description{
The Cole-Kripke sleep scoring algorithm is primarily used for adult
populations as the supporting research was performed on subjects
ranging from 35 to 65 years of age.
}
\details{
The original paper proposes three versions of the Cole-Kripke algorithm,
optimized for 1-minute, 30-second and 10-second epochs. Here only the 1-min
version is implemented and therefore the \code{\link[=apply_cole_kripke]{apply_cole_kripke()}} function
requires that the activity data is in 60s epochs. Use the \code{\link[=collapse_epochs]{collapse_epochs()}}
function to modify higher-frequency data, if necessary.

The Cole-Kripke algorithm uses the y-axis (axis 1) counts. First epoch
counts are divided by 100 and any scaled counts over 300 are clipped to 300.
This transformation is specific to ActiGraph devices. The sleep index (SI)
is defined as\preformatted{.001 * (106 * epoch_prev(4) + 54 * epoch_prev(3) +
         58 * epoch_prev(2) + 76 * epoch_prev(1) +
        230 * epoch +
         74 * epoch_next(1) + 67 * epoch_next(2))
}

where at epoch \code{t}, \code{epoch_prev(i)} is the scaled activity count \code{i} epochs
\emph{before} \code{t}. Similarly, \code{epoch_next(i)} is the scaled activity count \code{i}
epochs \emph{after} \code{t}. That is, the algorithm  uses a 7-epoch window which
includes the four preceding and the two subsequent epochs. The time series
of activity counts is padded with zeros as necessary, at the beginning and
at the end.

Finally, the sleep state is awake (W) if the sleep index SI is less
than 1; otherwise the sleep state is asleep (S).
