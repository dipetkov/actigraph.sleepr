\title{Apply the Cole-Kripke algorithm}
\usage{
apply_cole_kripke(agdb)
}
\arguments{
\item{agdb}{A \code{tibble} (\code{tbl}) of activity data (at least) an
\code{epochlength} attribute. The epoch length must be 60 seconds.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} (\code{tbl}) of activity data. A new column
\code{sleep} indicates whether each 60s epoch is scored as asleep (S)
or awake (W).
}
\description{
The Cole-Kripke sleep scoring algorithm is primarily used for adult
populations as the supporting research was performed on subjects
ranging from 35 to 65 years of age.
}
\details{
The Cole-Kripke algorithm requires that the activity data is in 60s epochs
and uses a 7-minute window that includes the four previous and two future
epochs. This function implements the algorithm as described in the ActiGraph
user manual.

The Cole-Kripke algorithm uses the y-axis (axis 1) counts. First epoch
counts are divided by 100 and afterwards any scaled counts over 300 are
set to 300. The sleep index (SI) is defined as

\code{
.001 * (106 * Epoch_prev(4) + 54 * Epoch_prev(3) +
         58 * Epoch_prev(2) + 76 * Epoch_prev(1) +
        230 * Epoch +
         74 * Epoch_next(1) + 67 * Epoch_next(2))
}

where at epoch \code{t}, \code{Epoch_prev(i)} is the scaled activity count
\code{i} epochs before \code{t}. Similarly, \code{Epoch_next(i)} is the scaled
activity count \code{i} epochs before \code{t}. The time series of activity counts
is padded with zeros as necessary, at the beginning and at the end.

Finally, the sleep state is awake (W) if the sleep index SI is less than 1;
otherwise the sleep state is asleep (S).
